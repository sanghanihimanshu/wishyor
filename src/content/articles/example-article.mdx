# How to Build a Modern Web App

Building a modern web application involves several key steps and best practices. In this article, we'll cover the essentials:

## 1. Choose the Right Framework

Select a framework that fits your project needs. Popular choices include React, Vue, and Svelte.

## 2. Set Up Your Project Structure

Organize your codebase for scalability. Use folders for components, pages, and utilities.

## 3. Implement Responsive Design

Ensure your app works on all devices by using responsive CSS frameworks or utilities like Tailwind CSS.

## 4. Optimize for Performance

Lazy-load assets, use code splitting, and optimize images to improve load times.

Deploy your app using platforms like Vercel, Netlify, or your own server. Set up monitoring and error tracking.
