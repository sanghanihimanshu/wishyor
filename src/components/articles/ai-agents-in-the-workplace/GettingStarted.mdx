## Getting Started: Tips for Embracing AI Agents

1. **Start Small:** Identify one or two workflows where AI can make a quick impact—like scheduling, document summarization, or customer support.
2. **Involve Your Team:** Encourage feedback and experimentation. The best ideas often come from those closest to the work.
3. **Focus on Outcomes:** Measure success by how much time and energy your team saves—and how much more creative and satisfied they feel.
4. **Invest in Training:** Help your team understand AI’s capabilities and limitations.
5. **Review Regularly:** Continuously assess and refine your AI workflows for maximum benefit.
