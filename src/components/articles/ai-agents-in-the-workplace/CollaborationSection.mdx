## Collaboration Without Boundaries

AI agents are breaking down silos. They connect data from different departments, surface insights that would otherwise go unnoticed, and help teams collaborate across time zones.

**How AI enables collaboration:**
- Integrates information from multiple sources (CRM, email, project management).
- Suggests cross-team connections and opportunities.
- Facilitates asynchronous work by summarizing discussions and decisions.

With AI handling the heavy lifting, people can focus on strategy, empathy, and innovationâ€”the things humans do best.
